                                The Gaddis are a prominent indigenous community of Himachal Pradesh, particularly found in the mountainous regions of Chamba, Kangra, and parts of Kullu. Known for their semi-nomadic lifestyle, the Gaddi people are primarily shepherds, migrating with their herds of sheep and goats between higher altitudes in summer and lower regions in winter. Their culture is deeply entwined with their pastoral lifestyle, and their unique clothing, such as the traditional *pattu* shawl, represents their identity and survival in the harsh mountainous conditions. These shawls are handwoven and made from locally sourced wool, with intricate patterns signifying different Gaddi tribes and regions.

This agricultural festival brings the community together for offerings to local deities, prayers, and dance.

Rituals often include offerings of food and animal sacrifices. The Gaddi community remains closely connected to nature, with their customs, music, and dances reflecting a deep respect for the mountains, animals, and the natural world.
