Fruit cultivation is a major aspect of its agriculture, with apples being the most significant crop, particularly in Shimla, Kullu, and Kinnaur districts. Pears, cherries, plums, apricots, and almonds are also widely grown. Vegetables such as potatoes, tomatoes, peas, and cauliflower thrive in the region's temperate zones. The state government and various agricultural universities provide support through research, training, and subsidies to enhance production and quality. The unique topography and climate variations, ranging from subtropical to temperate, enable year-round cultivation of different crops, contributing significantly to the local economy. Organic farming practices are also being promoted to maintain ecological balance and ensure sustainable agriculture.</div>
