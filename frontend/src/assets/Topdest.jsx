    Himachal was known as a summer destination, the Department of Tourism & Civil Aviation has taken special 
    efforts to break the seasonality factor and has developed diversified tourism products to attract tourists
     in other seasons too. Now Himachal is known as “A Destination for All Seasons and All Reasons”. In fact,
      the Department has laid a special emphasis on the development of activity-based tourism and opening up of 
      new sub destinations. To promote tourism in the countryside and to unexplored areas., appropriate infrastructure is being developed.
      This includes enhancing road connectivity, setting up eco-friendly accommodations, and promoting homestays to give tourists an authentic local
       experience. Furthermore, the state is investing in sustainable tourism practices to preserve its natural beauty while boosting the local economy.
